# Billy's Billing PHP SDK [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/lsolesen/billysbilling.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/lsolesen/billysbilling)

PHP SDK for [Billy's Billing API](https://billysbilling.com/api) version 2 only from the Danish accounting program [Billy's Billing](http://www.billysbilling.dk/).

**Note:** This SDK only works with API v2. We have a new SDK in the works for v2. See also [v1 PHP-SDK](https://github.com/billysbilling/billysbilling-php).

## Examples

The API for this PHP-SDK is still in development. Use with care. Please see the test files in the tests directory at the moment.

See examples on usage in the 'tests' directory.
